About the films In the early 20th century, filmmakers were frequently compared to hypnotists, enticing hysterical movie audiences with wild collective hallucinations! In these rarely seen films curated by UMN\u2019s Maggie Hennefeld, a woman is hypnotized by a Svengali, a jealous lover practices tele-hypnosis to defeat his rival, an overworked housemaid has sleeping sickness, a female coach drive can\u2019t believe her eyes, an obsessive inventor gives us a sneak preview of Zoom, and cinematography offers a miraculous cure to hysterical amnesia.

Christa R\u00fcbsam Schneider is a cellist and violinist who has been performing since 2003 in the Twin Cities and globally with various musical groups ranging in style from new music to jazz to cinematic chamber. Her father, Wolfgang R\u00fcbsam, is a notable organist and formed her ear and love for early music. She has been involved in several theater productions including the upcoming production, RARE: Stories of Dis-Ease, by Kevin Kling. She has also co-composed, arranged, and performed live original scores for a number of silent films shown at venues such as the Trylon Microcinema, the Heights Theater, and Movies in the Park. Christa regularly plays with Dreamland Faces, is jazz trio leader of Ensemble Pro Arte and teaches private lessons to budding musicians. About the venue Northrop is a performing arts center on the University of Minnesota's East Bank campus. The auditorium offers world-class dance and music performances, speakers, films, artist workshops and more. Northrop is also home to the Aeolian-Skinner Opus 892 pipe organ built in the 1930s . This incredible instrument was restored in 2018 with the help of The Friends of the Northrop Organ committee. We are excited and grateful to be able to compose for this pipe organ and perform new music on it.","title":"About the program"},{"location":"#hysteria-hypnosis-and-hallucination-silent-cinema-shorts","text":"Dreamland Faces will be accompanying five silent short films at Northop on October 18, 2022.

The Desks KADOR communicates much of its plot through letters, a device known in literature as \u201cepistolary.\u201d While nearly all silent films rely on text in the form of title cards or written communication, the act of writing and reading letters is a central activity in Kador . Each notable character has their own writing desk, with a unique style. Across its 40 minute runtime, there are six different writing desks placed in the center of the action. The lawyer\u2019s desk The first desk we see is that of a probate lawyer reading a will to our main characters (Susanne and Fernand). The decorated desk is formal, topped with some paperwork and a small bust. The desk is at the center of the frame angled slightly left. Susanne\u2019s secretary desk Next, we see our heroine Susanne\u2019s small writing desk. This is a secretary design, where the writing ledge folds out. Susanne clearly enjoys writing and gazes thoughtfully into the distance and she considerers what to write. When she starts leaves the room, she makes a point to go back and lock it - telling us that there is something intimate and secretive about her writing. Susanne\u2019s desk is at the edge of the screen facing left. Fernand\u2019s desk Fernand is our villian. He has a small, cramped desk that faces directly toward the camera. Here is where he carries out his forgeries and is shown burning a letter. Jean\u2019s desk Most of this desk is out of the picture, but it is clearly meant to be an impressive piece of furniture, set amidst an elegant room. Captain Jean is often on the telephone as well, perhaps signaling that he is a modern & progressive individual. Jean\u2019s desk faces screen right. The scientist\u2019s desk The captain, with his can-do attitude, visits a doctor to consult on possible treatments for Susanne. The doctors desk looks sturdy and is topped with glass vials and science-y paraphernalia. The doctor\u2019s desk faces away from the camera. The police desk This desk is in a similar position to the lawyer\u2019s office - center screen, angled slightly left. This utilitarian piece of furniture is sparsely adorned in a plain room. Scoring an epistolary film Much of the action in this film takes place while our characters are sitting at desks. Indeed, they spend plenty of time reading and writing. However, they are also reacting - sighing with longing, huffing with anger, plotting evil plans, mulling over Susanne\u2019s mysterious condition, scheming scenarios for justice, and confronting one another over forged missives. How do you effectively score a scene where people are just reading or writing? The only visible movement on the screen is often a quick dip of a pen in an inkwell. One technique I have used it to create instrumental lines that are reminiscent of recitativo , or spoke-sung lines in opera. I often add lyrics to the score, even though no one will actually be singing them. It helps the players understand the gist of the scene and play expressively. an excerpt from my Kador score, with a cello recitativo line with lyrics another excerpt with the accordion leading the narrative Where is Kador? There are many scenes that were filmed on a rocky beach in France. Being unfamiliar with French geography, I was not sure initially where this film is meant to take place.

Roughly: 1894-1929, with those from the 10s and 20s most commonly still available Early films were often experimental with interesting camera tricks. Films made through the 1910s may be challenging for modern audiences. The pacing may seem comparatively slow - often including long static scenes of people talking. Films from the 1920s are often very sophisticated with engaging plots and the acting became more naturalistic. Once sound films were developed in 1929, very few silents were made again How were scores created for silent films originally? Usually improvised by a single accompanist, who would draw upon popular songs and classical themes. Small theaters would feature a pianist, but theatre organs were installed all over the country. The Heights Theater in Columbia Heights still has a working theater organ. Some films were issued with \u201ccue sheets\u201d that indicated when actions changed and included suggested musical themes. Studios with bigger budgets could develop original scores. What are some general scoring strategies? Set list method This involves compiling a list of known tunes and adjusting their form to fit within sections Example Our score to LOVE AND SCIENCE is made up of many waltzes that we have played as a band over the years. Improvisation Improvising to a film is a long tradition, especially during the time period when composers were not able to watch the screening in advance. Example Our accompaniment to the one-minute film, AT THE HYPNOTISTS, is completely improvised. Composed Create a through-composed score, with transitions and every moment accounted for. Example Our accompaniment to HYPNOTIZING THE HYPNOTISTS is a through-composed score. Combination Accompanists may want to use more than one strategy per film. Many feature silent films have the same lengths as today (1:15 - 2:30 hours), so a combination of the above may help fill out the length and provide variety. Example For THE MYSTERY OF THE ROCKS OF KADOR, we use all of the techniques listed above. Unsynchronized Honorable mention - an alternative option is to largely not pay attention to the film. This is often employed by a popular band or sound art project. In this case, the film is part of a multimedia experience and it enhances the soundscape. What are some more specific scoring tips? Keep transitions flexible- make it easy to lengthen or shorten sections Recruit a sound effects person or percussionist Add planned improv sections for eerie or chaotic scenes Give instrumentalists extended rests to break up the action and give them a break What are some issues with silent film accompaniment to know about? Film is a sequence of stills. Silent films were shot at variable speeds (or \"frame rates\") anywhere from 12 fps to 26 fps. Film projectors used to have mechanisms to adjust the frame rate during playback. Most modern projectors do not have this functionality anymore - there are only a few theaters across the country that can do this. That is why you often see silent films that appear to be moving at breakneck speed. The \u201cscreener\u201d you use to score the film may not match the speed at which it gets projected. The films often feature offensive stereotypes and costuming. Are they still worth showing? There might be brief gags or background extras that you don\u2019t notice upon first viewing. You may need to do research about the filmmakers to understand the context. Depending upon your audience, acknowledging this can be helpful. Silent film buffs may prefer to hear authentic period music. Why would a modern composer score an old silent film? A silent film score can facilitate creating a long form composition with built in thematic variations Visuals and action may inspire you to develop new themes or rhythms you haven't used before All films made in the US before 1923 are public domain. Copyrights vary on other films from the 20s. Unlike sound films, you do not have to compose around a pre-existing soundtrack with dialogue and sound effects Although most silent films are considered lost, they are often uncovered in archives and restored. They are then \u201cpremiered\u201d at film festivals, often with a newly commissioned score. Like a poem, silent films don\u2019t typically have \u201cofficial\u201d scores, and can be re-scored over and over. Many are even issued digitally / on DVD with multiple accompaniment options. Warning An exception is several Charlie Chaplin films. Chaplin composed scored for his films years later and his estate has strict rules that the films can only be shown if you use Chaplin\u2019s score, with precise instrumentation.","title":"Scoring Silent Films"},{"location":"scoringSilents/#scoring-silents","text":"FAQs on Composing Live Accompaniment for Silent Films","title":"Scoring Silents"},{"location":"scoringSilents/#when-were-silent-films-made","text":"Roughly: 1894-1929, with those from the 10s and 20s most commonly still available Early films were often experimental with interesting camera tricks.
